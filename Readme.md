1) Install dependencies for root/backend/frontend [run npm -i in each folder]
2) npm start (from root folder) [I've configured it to run front and backend with 1 command]
3) Should be: (http://localhost:4000) [Your terminal should show you the port it uses if you've started a bunch of sessions without terminating as vite auto-starts on next avail port)
